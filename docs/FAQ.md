# FAQ

## Why isn’t my item showing up?
- Make sure the file is in the correct folder (`/themes` or `/configs`).
- The extension must be `.tandemt` or `.tandemc`.
- Wait for the GitHub Pages workflow to finish (Actions tab).

## Why is the preview missing?
- Check that the preview image matches the exact slug.
- Allowed formats: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.webp`.
- If a preview is missing, a “Preview coming soon” placeholder appears.

## How do I show tags in the gallery?
- Add `metadata.tags` to the `.tandemt` file (array or comma-separated string).

## Can I submit a theme or config?
- Not right now. This library is curated and accepts no public submissions.

## What can I do with these files?
- See the LICENSE for usage rights. In short: free to download and use, but not resell as standalone assets.
