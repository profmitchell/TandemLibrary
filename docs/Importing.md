# Importing into Tandem

1. Download a `.tandemt` (theme) or `.tandemc` (canvas/config) file from the gallery.
2. Open Tandem and choose **Import/Install** (or drag the file onto the app window).
3. Confirm the import and apply the theme or config from your library.

Tips:
- Keep the original file if you want to share or reinstall later.
- If the item doesn’t appear immediately, restart Tandem after importing.
